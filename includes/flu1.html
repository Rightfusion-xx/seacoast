  Bovine Colostrum is Clinically Proven to Contain the Highest Levels of an Immune-Building 
  Antibody known as Immunoglobulin G (IgG)<br>

  Sedona, Arizona, October 20, 2004 - In light of the recent flu vaccine shortage, 
  health officials announced that there are other things people can do if they 
  are not going to be able to get flu shots. In response, The Center for Nutritional 
  Research (&quot;CNR&quot;) (www.icnr.org) offers two free guides &quot;12 Important 
  Tips to Avoid the Flu and Five Ways to Build a Strong Immune System&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;A NEW ITEM on the list this season is bovine colostrum, one of nature's 
  best kept secrets since it contains the highest levels of a natural powerful 
  anti&shy;body known as Immunoglobulin G (lgG) - up to 20 times the amount of 
  (lgG) that is found in human colostrum,&quot; said Doug Wyatt, co-founder of 
  the CNR. &quot;Studies prove that Immunoglobulin G found in bovine colostrum 
  provides passive systemic immunity against pathogens, bacteria, viruses and 
  fungi that are responsible for causing E. coli, upper respiratory infec&shy;tions, 
  pneumonia, and the flu. And bovine colostrum can be found in your local health 
  food store.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  In a recent CDC warning, health officials stated that people who are run down 
  and overworked could increase their risk of illness. &quot;Add the immune-sup&shy;pressing 
  effects of stress, illness, and too much &quot;pre&shy;pared&quot; food in the 
  diet,&quot; said Wyatt, &quot;and you want to be taking something that can give 
  your immune system a natural boost as well as provide powerful protection against 
  the flu virus, bacteria and other pathogens.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Immunoglobulin Therapy used by Doctors for Years. Imunoglobulins are antibodies 
  produced by our bodies that specifically target many of the most dangerous pathogens 
  we are likely to encounter. Immunoglobulins specifically recognize any foreign 
  compound that enters the body. When one enters, various antibodies direct themselves 
  to different areas of the invader and attack it, wherever it is in the body. 
  Doctors have been suc&shy;cessfully using immunoglobulin therapy for years in 
  the fight against a host of viruses such as the flu, respirato&shy;ry infections 
  and Hepatitis.<br>
  <br>
  The advantages to immunoglobulin-derived passive immunity are: (1) Pathogens 
  can't build up resistance to immunoglobulins because the body can design new 
  antibodies faster than the pathogens can come up with new ways to defeat them 
  and; (2) the body doesn't even have to be exposed to the pathogen to build immunity 
  against it.<br>
  <br>
  What is the best source of Immunoglobulins for Immune Support? Clinically proven 
  bovine colostrum. This is the first milk produced by the mother cow that is 
  loaded with immune, growth and tissue repair factors to aid in the development 
  of immunity in the newborn calf and it contains 40% concentration of Immunoglobulin 
  G (lgG). Make sure that it is BIO&shy;lipid coated to maximize absorption and 
  flash pasteur&shy;ized to maintain maximum milk protein survival. Bovine colostrum 
  is available in capsule, powder or fla&shy;vored chewable tablets.<br>
  <br>
  Add The Benefits of Walking To The Mix. The result of a new study conducted 
  by Dr. Monika Fleshner at the University of Colorado at Boulder, reveals that 
  reg&shy;ular walking, cycling or other moderate exercise train&shy;ing may help 
  compensate for some of the immune sys&shy;tem changes observed in older people. 
  The physically active seniors in the study had a stronger immune sys&shy;tem 
  response than did their sedentary peers. In fact, their immune response was 
  similar to that observed among the younger men, reported Dr. Fleshner to Reuters 
  Health.<br>
  <br>
  Worried about the Flu?<br>
  Health officials are urging the public to &quot;keep their immune systems strong&quot; 
  and learn about healthy alter&shy;natives to &quot;take care of themselves&quot; 
  this flu season. If you're not going to get a flu shot, keep a healthy atti&shy;tude 
  and try nature's immune-support alternative, bovine colostrum with BIO-lipid, 
  request your FREE email guides and try walking or cycling.<br>
