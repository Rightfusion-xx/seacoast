  <font size="3">with Natural Black Elderberry</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We all know the knock-you-off-your-feet 
  misery of the flu: the aches, chills, fever, dry cough and lingering exhaustion. 
  And chances are many of us will feel it again sometime soon. In fact, experts 
  at the US centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that up to one-fourth 
  of the country's populations gets the flu in any one flu season, which ordinarily 
  runs from November to March. Children are two to three times more likely than 
  adults to get the flu. And kids often spread the illness to adults. Most people 
  who come down with he flu recover within a week. But influenza and its complications, 
  including bronchitis and pneumonia, are serious enough to cause more then 100,000 
  hospitalization and up to 70,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For whom is the risk of 
  complications most significant?</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Newborns</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyone over age 50</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People with chronic illnesses, 
    including heart disease or diabetes</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These individuals are also 
  at the greatest risk of experiencing life - threatening complications with influenza</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What Causes Flu?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Behind the symptoms of flu 
  is a respiratory infection caused by any one of a variety of influenza viruses 
  that scientists have separated into types A, B, and C. Type A is the most common 
  and can lead to serious flu epidemics. Type B can also causes epidemics, but 
  its symptoms are typically much milder To date, no major epidemics have been 
  linked to Type C viruses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We catch the flu by being 
  around someone who already has the illness, so it's not surprising that we are 
  most in danger of becoming infected in areas crowded with people, such as theaters, 
  schools, and airplanes. When people with he flu cough or sneeze the virus is 
  passed into the air via respiratory droplets witch we can then inhale. We can 
  also become infected by touching objects that a person with the flue has touched(telephones, 
  doorknobs, and pencils) and then transferring the virus to our nose or mouth. 
  For children the close quarters they keep with classmates at school increases 
  their potential for infection and the subsequent spread of the flu</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Prevention and Vaccination</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How can flu be prevented? 
  Prevention or those people most at risk beings with immunization against influenza. 
  Flu shots are usually effective, especially when received six to eight weeks 
  before flu season beings. Each year a new vaccine is made based on scientific 
  evaluation of the flu viruses currently circulation or those expected to circulate 
  later that winter. Sometimes, however, and unexpected flu virus appears, for 
  with the vaccine may not be as effective. Universal precautions included limiting 
  our interaction with those who already have the flu and washing our hands after 
  coming in contact with them or any objects they may have touched.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Speed Recovery with Elderberry</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some over-the-counter flu 
  medicines provide temporary relief of symptoms, yet they do not shorten the 
  duration of illness or address the underlying infection. Specific pharmaceutical 
  agents - new and old - hold promise for shortening the duration of the flu, 
  but some of them have been associated with troubling side effects. Mother Nature, 
  however, does provide at least one compelling answer to recovery form the flu, 
  as virologist Madeleine Mumcuoglu, PhD, discovered during work on her doctoral 
  thesis. The natural substances found with black elderberries can disarm flu 
  viruses and enhance clinical recovery time by 50 percents. &quot;Black elderberry 
  is one of our best defenses against the advance of influenza, Especially when 
  taken at the first sign of symptoms,&quot; says Dr. Mumcuoglu. &quot;Flu viruses 
  are covered by tiny protein spikes of hemagglutinin [chemical substances], which 
  they use to attach to and infect healthy human cells&quot; &quot;While I was 
  working on my doctorate, my team isolated key active components within black 
  elderberry that disarm hemagglutinin and thus stop the first step of viral invasion. 
  The virus can no longer reproduce itself, so the infection is defeated,&quot; 
  she says</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Mumcuoglu developed 
  the Sambucol black elderberry extract, which has been clinically shown to reduce 
  symptoms and shorten duration of influenza type A and B. In one study 60 patients 
  (29 females 31 males) aged 18 to 54 years with documented influenza were enrolled 
  in a double-blind placebo-controleed study. Patients were randomly assigned 
  to two groups, with one given elderberry extract and the other group five a 
  placebo, both in a dose of 15ml (one tablespoon) four times a day for five days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On average, patients taking 
  the elderberry extract recovered in 3.1 days compared with 7.1 days for those 
  given placebo. These results are consistent with an early study that find nearly 
  90 percent of Flu patients given the elderberry extract were completely free 
  of symptoms within two to three days, as compared to atleast six days with placebo. 
  Black elderberry extract can be safely given to both children and adults-with 
  no know side effects or drug interactions. Just don't expect Grandma's elderberry 
  jam to ease flu-related body aches, coughs, and fevers. Dr. Mumcuoglu's extract 
  is elderberry preparations that has been tested and shown effective in published 
  research studies on influenza. Elderberry remedies are available at health food 
  stores where they are sold as dietary supplements, rather than as drugs approved 
  by the US Food and Drug Administrations. Elderberry is no intended as a substitute 
  for getting a flue shot. But when the misery of flu strikes, as it can even 
  after having received your flue shot, elderberry extract may be the best available 
  remedy to secure a rapid recovery</font></p>
