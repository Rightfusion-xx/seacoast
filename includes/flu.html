      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We all know the knock-you-off-your-feet 
        misery of the flu: the aches, <br>
        chills, fever, dry cough and lingering exhaustion. And chances are many 
        <br>
        of us will feel it again sometime soon. In fact, experts at the US <br>
        centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that up to <br>
        one-fourth of the country's populations gets the flu in any one flu <br>
        season, which ordinarily runs from November to March. Children are two 
        <br>
        to three times more likely than adults to get the flu. And kids often 
        <br>
        spread the illness to adults. Most people who come down with he flu <br>
        recover within a week. But influenza and its complications, including 
        <br>
        bronchitis and pneumonia, are serious enough to cause more then 100,000 
        <br>
        hospitalization and up to 70,000 deaths each year in the United States 
        <br>
        alone.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Behind the symptoms of flu 
        is a respiratory infection caused by any one <br>
        of a variety of influenza viruses that scientists have separated into 
        <br>
        types A, B, and C. Type A is the most common and can lead to serious flu 
        <br>
        epidemics. Type B can also causes epidemics, but its symptoms are <br>
        typically much milder To date, no major epidemics have been linked to 
        <br>
        Type C viruses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We catch the flu by being around 
        someone who already has the illness, so <br>
        it's not surprising that we are most in danger of becoming infected in 
        <br>
        areas crowded with people, such as theaters, schools, and airplanes. <br>
        When people with he flu cough or sneeze the virus is passed into the air 
        <br>
        via respiratory droplets witch we can then inhale. We can also become 
        <br>
        infected by touching objects that a person with the flu has <br>
        touched(telephones, doorknobs, and pencils) and then transferring the 
        <br>
        virus to our nose or mouth. For children the close quarters they keep 
        <br>
        with classmates at school increases their potential for infection and 
        <br>
        the subsequent spread of the flu</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some over-the-counter flu medicines 
        provide temporary relief of <br>
        symptoms, yet they do not shorten the duration of illness or address the 
        <br>
        underlying infection. Specific pharmaceutical agents - new and old - <br>
        hold promise for shortening the duration of the flu, but some of them 
        <br>
        have been associated with troubling side effects. Mother Nature, <br>
        however, does provide at least one compelling answer to recovery form 
        <br>
        the flu, as virologist Madeleine Mumcuoglu, PhD, discovered during work 
        <br>
        on her doctoral thesis. The natural substances found with black <br>
        elderberries can disarm flu viruses and enhance clinical recovery time 
        <br>
        by 50 percents. &quot;Black elderberry is one of our best defenses against 
        <br>
        the advance of influenza, Especially when taken at the first sign of <br>
        symptoms,&quot; says Dr. Mumcuoglu. &quot;Flu viruses are covered by tiny 
        protein <br>
        spikes of hemagglutinin [chemical substances], which they use to attach 
        <br>
        to and infect healthy human cells&quot; &quot;While I was working on my 
        doctorate, <br>
        my team isolated key active components within black elderberry that <br>
        disarm hemagglutinin and thus stop the first step of viral invasion. The 
        <br>
        virus can no longer reproduce itself, so the infection is defeated,&quot; 
        she says</font></p>

        Elderberry remedies are available at health food stores where they are 
        <br>
        sold as dietary supplements, rather than as drugs approved by the US <br>
        Food and Drug Administrations. Elderberry is no intended as a substitute

        for getting a flu shot. But when the misery of flu strikes, as it can 
        <br>
        even after having received your flu shot, elderberry extract may be the
