        <p>Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the U.S., totaling 
          more than cancer and AIDS combined. In light of the marginal success 
          of standard treatments for heart disease, chelation therapy offers an 
          extremely safe and effective way of not only stopping the progression 
          of heart disease, but also of reversing its effects. This booklet gives 
          a comprehensive overview of chelation therapy: its history, supporting 
          research, and its use in modern medicine. </p>
