<p>Researchers at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences have recently discovered new benefits for naturally occurring compounds, called echinacosides in Echinacea. Although well-known for its support of immune system activity, clinical studies have found that certain echinacosides can significantly reduce feelings of anxiety and tension.

Cold ?™ contains two standardized herbal extracts to help boost the immune system. Andrographis has been an important herb in Ayurvedic medicine since ancient times. Native to southern Asia, it is sometimes called the “King of Bitters” because of its extremely bitter taste. Pelargonium sidoides, commonly known as Umckaloabo or South African Geranium, also has a long history of traditional use in South Africa. The beneficial parts of the plant are the root and rhizome.  Each contains very high levels of their key active compounds – andrographolides and umckalin, respectively – to yield a very powerful and potent immune support formula.*</p><p><strong>

Andrographis (Andrographis paniculata) </strong>
Well known for its immune-supporting effects, clinical trials have verified that andrographis can provide significant support for lung and respiratory health. The standardized extract used in Cold ? was shown in a clinical trial to safely support the immune system and increase the body’s natural resistance.</p><p><strong>

Pelargonium (Pelargonium sidoides) </strong>
With safety and efficacy for both adults and children established in clinical trials, Pelargonium sidoides has multiple mechanisms of action. It is a potent immunomodulator, stimulating the synthesis and activity of key immune system cells, including macrophages. Pelargonium also has cell-protective effects, and supports respiratory health through stimulation of ciliary activity (beat frequency).* Cilia are the hair-like structures lining the airways.</p>

<p> This proprietary complex provides enhanced bioavailability and sustained retention time in the body, using patent-pending technology.</p>
<p>While the health benefits of curcumin, the active compound from the Indian spice known as turmeric, have been well-documented, it is also well-known that curcumin is not well-absorbed when taken orally (by mouth). Different methods have been used to increase absorption, including combining curcumin with lecithin or piperine (black pepper). The best absorption has been achieved when micronized (very small particles) curcumin is combined with turmeric oils and phospholipids. This combination is 6.9 times more absorbable than regular curcumin, and 6.3 times better absorbed than curcumin with lecithin and piperine.</p><p><strong>

Curcumin </strong>
Curcumin, a compound found in the spice turmeric, inhibits multiple inflammation pathways in the body. It is also a potent antioxidant. Some of the benefits associated with curcumin include immune system modulation, protection from oxidative stress, and support for the body’s natural anti-inflammatory response.* The specialized extract in this formula has the highest absorption of any curcumin extract available for maximum health benefits.</p><p>

Vitamin D</strong>has protective effects for brain cells. In clinical trials, higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with improved mental function. Additional studies, particularly in older adults, have found that increased serum levels of vitamin D are associated with healthy cognitive (brain) function.</p><p><strong>
Curcumin</strong> has many mechanisms by which it supports memory. As a potent antioxidant it protects cells from free radicals; it supports the body’s natural anti-inflammatory response; it supports healthy neuron function; and supports healthy beta amyloid levels in the brain. A form of curcumin has also been studied in combination with vitamin D, which may enhance its brain supportive effects.</p><p><strong>
