Researchers believe D-phenylalanine (DPA) inhibits the action of an enzyme that breaks down endorphins and enkephalins.  These are proteins which bind to opiate receptor sites in the brain, thereby influencing the perception of discomfort.  By obstructing the action of this enzyme, DPA may extend the life of endorphins and enkephalins, and their positive influence on comfort levels.  L-Phenylalanine is the precursor to two neurotransmitters that help support an alert state.	http://www.seacoastvitamins.com/product_info.php?products_id=6447	http://www.seacoastvitamins.com/images/74_GP1100.jpg	SN0164	In-Stock	New				Lowest Shipping Cost Guarantee	021078001645	6.80

XyliWhite is a remarkable new toothpaste gel from NOW Foods that uses Xylitol, a natural sugar alcohol that looks and tastes similar to conventional sugar with one major exception - it has 40% fewer calories! Unlike many of the chemicals found in other fluoride based, whitening toothpastes, xylitol is a natural, well-tolerated substance commonly found in fruits, berries and other natural sources. In fact, the human body even manufactures its own supply - up to 15 grams, everyday. Xyliwhite is an all-natural refreshmint toothpaste made from select materials and guaranteed to be of superior quality.* Xyliwhite toothpaste is completely safe for users of every age. Our decision to introduce new Xyliwhite toothpaste was not made overnight. Rather, it was the result of intense worldwide research and official endorsements from 6 international dental associations.  Though it was discovered in the 1800s, xylitol research has surged over the last 50 years. Some of the most notable studies (including those conducted at Finlands Turku University) have tested xylitols ability to fight cavities, plaque, gingivitis, dry mouth and bad breath. Others have tested its ability to help neutralize plaque acids, assist in the re-mineralization of tooth enamel and attack the bacteria that can cause tooth decay. At the end of the day, this research ultimately suggests that xylitol may help promote a smile that is whiter, brighter and far more healthy.

Manganese, which is concentrated mainly in the liver, skeleton, pancreas, and brain, is considered important because it is used to make several key enzymes in the body and activates others. For example, one of the enzymes made from manganese is called superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant facilitator.
While most authorities agree that manganese is a vital micronutrient, it is not known for certain if taking extra amounts can be helpful in treating osteoporosis, menstrual symptoms, or other problems.	http://www.seacoastvitamins.com/product_info.php?products_id=8193	http://www.seacoastvitamins.com/images/20_2711_Chelated_Manganese.jpg	2713	In-Stock	New				Lowest Shipping Cost Guarantee	015794027133	5.82

Mangosteen is a fruit common to Southeast Asia that naturally contains a powerful antioxidant component called xanthones. Xanthones have been studied for their ability to offer beneficial antioxidant support to the body. Current studies suggest that the oxidation due to free radical damage contributes to such factors as aging and other health related concerns.
Noni is a fruit common to French Polynesian cultures such as Tahiti. This fruit is said to have positive effects on the cardiovascular, immune and digestive systems. Noni is naturally high in minerals such as magnesium and calcium. It also contains vitamin C and niacin.	http://www.seacoastvitamins.com/product_info.php?products_id=8630	http://www.seacoastvitamins.com/images/20_8001_LiquidMulti.jpg	8001	In-Stock	New				Lowest Shipping Cost Guarantee	015794080015	20.70
